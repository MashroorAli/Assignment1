        The leafy sea dragon, is a beautiful marine fish of the same family as the seahorse. Originally from Australia, they have long leaf-shaped extensions that are distributed throughout their body, which helps them camouflage themselves. This is one of the most desired exotic animals in the world.

        They look like floating algae and because of their physical characteristics, they are the object of various threats. They are trapped by collectors and even used in alternative medicine. Their current status is of minor concern, yet they are protected by the Australian government.    </p>
